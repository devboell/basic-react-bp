Basic boilerplate for React experiments or to make a minimal repo for reproducing bugs.

#### notes:
- image support. It serves static images located in `src/images` from `images`. It also supports images imported as a module. (see example in `src/App/index.js`).
- it's possible to call jest's `toMatchSnapshot()` on enzyme wrappers.
- just empty `src/App` and `src/images` to start clean.
